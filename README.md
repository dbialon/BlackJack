Blackjack card game with GUI

This is my first try at creating a fully functional blackjack game with GUI.
I'll start this project with a text version incorporating functions to run the game.
Once there is a working version of the game I will move toward object oriented programming.
At the end I will create a graphical interface which will by my first ever attempt to do so.
I decided to use pygame to achieve it as I've never used it before and this will be a great
opportunity to learn it as I go.
